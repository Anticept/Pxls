            <dt>How do I appeal a ban?</dt>
            <dd>First make sure you've read the rules in the info panel, then contact us on <a href="https://pxls.space/discord" target="_blank">Discord</a> or send an appeal to our <a href="https://pxls.space/appeal" target="_blank">google forms</a>.</dd>
            <dt>How do I report bugs?</dt>
            <dd>Submit them to the #game-sugestions channel in the <a href="https://pxls.space/discord" target="_blank">discord</a>. If it's an exploit, feel free to PM one of the developers directly.</dd>
            <dt>How to get 2/6 pixels?</dt>
            <dd>Wait longer, pixels gain passively over time.</dd>
            <dt>Why does it take so long to get more pixels?</dt>
            <dd>This is by design, it's much more efficient to place them as soon as you get them. Pixel stacking is meant to give you a bit of a bump if you go AFK for a while. It takes around 40 minutes to get a full stack of 6/6 pixels, however it only takes around 3 minutes to place 6 pixels on their own.</dd>
            <dt>Why does it say 0/6 placeable?</dt>
            <dd>Pixels gain passively over time, once you place a pixel you're on cooldown until you can place again.</dd>
            <dt>Why is the cooldown different now than it was yesterday?</dt>
            <dd>The cooldown is dynamic and changes based on how many people are online. More people means longer cooldown.</dd>
            <dt>How do I make a template?</dt>
            <dd>Most people use the 3rd party tool <a href="https://pxlsfiddle.com/" target="_blank">PxlsFiddle</a> to turn pixel art into a template. If you need to make pixel art, you can try using <a href="http://www.piskelapp.com/p/create" target="_blank">Piskel</a> to create sprites then use those sprites in PxlsFiddle.</dd>
            <dt>How do I move a template?</dt>
            <dd>Hold <kbd>CTRL</kbd> (or <kbd>OPTION</kbd> on mac) while click-and-dragging to reposition as needed. You can also tap-and-hold the top left corner where you want to move the template to and click "Move Template Here" in the resulting popup.</dd>
            <dt>What is the virginmap?</dt>
            <dd>The virginmap shows what pixels are still virgin.</dd>
            <dt>What is a virgin pixel?</dt>

            <dt>Do canvases reset?</dt>
            <dd>Yes</dd>
            <dt>How long until the next reset?</dt>
            <dd>Canvases are usually reset when they're full, staff do not have a set date until right at the end of the canvas. Updates are posted in our Discord server when a reset date is settled upon.</dd>
            <dt>Is there somewhere I can go to see past canvases?</dt>
            <dd>We post past canvases in our Discord server. There is also a 3rd party website that chronicles past canvases and shows a lot of useful stats which can be found <a href="https://www.pxlsfiddle.com/pxlsarchive/" target="_blank">here</a>.</dd>
